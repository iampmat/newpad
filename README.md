<new pad> simplifies the homepage experience. Whenever you open a new tab, a simple text editor appears. Use new tabs to write to-do lists, appointment times, or to just jot down notes. If you want to save it to your computer just file + save as, otherwise your notes will auto-save and will be there when you open a new tab.

Features:
- Auto-save
- Current date in the heading
